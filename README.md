# **Text Summarization using Genetic Algorithm**

An AI-based project using Python that implements a text summarization algorithm using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The program uses the genetic algorithm to generate summaries of input text.

## **Dependencies:**
+ `random`: Used for generating random numbers and selecting random sentences.
+ `heapq`: Used for selecting the top summaries based on fitness score.
+ `nltk`: The Natural Language Toolkit library, used for text processing and tokenization.
+ `rouge`: A Python library for computing ROUGE scores, used to evaluate the fitness of summaries.
+ `tkinter`: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Before running the program, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk rouge
```

Additionally, you need to download the required NLTK resources by running the following commands:

```python
import nltk

nltk.download("punkt")
nltk.download("stopwords")
```

## **Usage**
To use the text summarizer, follow these steps:

Run the program using Python.
+ Enter the text to be summarized in the input text box.
+ Click on the "English" button if the input text is in English or click on the "Indonesian" button if the input text is in Indonesian.
+ The program will display the summarized text in the output text box.

## **Algorithm Overview**
The program uses a genetic algorithm to generate summaries. Here is an overview of the algorithm:

+ **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by initializing a population of summaries. Each summary is randomly generated by selecting a subset of sentences from the original text.
+ **Evaluation**: Each summary in the population is evaluated based on its fitness score, which is calculated using the ROUGE-L metric. The fitness score represents how well the summary captures the important information from the original text.
+ **Selection**: The top half of the summaries in the population, based on fitness score, are selected to create the next generation of summaries.
+ **Crossover**: Pairs of selected summaries are combined through crossover to create two children summaries. Crossover involves merging sentences from the parent summaries to form new sentences in the children summaries.
+ **Mutation**: The children summaries undergo mutation, where a random sentence is either added or removed from the summary. This introduces diversity and helps explore different summary combinations.
+ **Population Update**: The mutated children summaries are added to the population, replacing the least fit summaries from the previous generation.
+ **Termination**: The algorithm repeats steps 2 to 6 for a set number of iterations or until a termination condition is met, such as reaching a maximum population size.
+ **Best Summary Selection**: After the algorithm terminates, the summary with the highest fitness score is selected as the final summary. If no summary is generated or the best summary is empty, the original text is used as a fallback.

## **Limitations**
+ The genetic algorithm used in this program may not always produce optimal summaries. The quality of the summaries heavily depends on the fitness function and the population size.
+ The program assumes that the input text is either in English or Indonesian. Modifying the program to support other languages would require adapting the stopword list and potentially other language-specific processing steps.
